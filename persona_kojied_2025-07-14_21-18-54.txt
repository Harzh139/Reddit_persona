üß† Reddit Persona Report for u/kojied

Occupation: Hi guys,

I think Pokemon could be one of the killer use case for the vision pro. Imagine, you could fight players from around the world from the comfort of your couch. With the recent controversy around Palworld, they're looking for the next "Pokemon Go" that would propel their franchise to the next level.

Being Japanese, I happen to know a few key decision makers both in the Pokemon Company as well as Niantic. Alot of the in-game designs are transferrable, and I believe it's a matter of time until Niantic's Lightship ARDK will work on AVP.

*What should I tell them? Lmk if you have thoughts or useful links/videos I should forward to them.*

I'm confident that this will eventually become a thing, but the faster they ship the more AVP adoption we'll see.

Location: There's this bar that I frequent a few blocks away from my house. Technically different neighborhood, but generally has a mature vibe with people who like music and to dance. Today when I went to the bar and all of a sudden I felt like I was at a college basement party. I thought that I must have been hallucinating, but Then a girl pointed at me and referred to me as the old person. That's when I knew I had to get out of there.
 I was at the wrong party. 

As I walk back home, all of a sudden I realize that there were now tens of thousands of 18 year-old 19 year-old 20-year-olds who were all living on top of each other and were super young and horny to basically use the New York nightlife as their own personal orgy dome.
 Naturally I felt violated

But then again, I thought to myself. Am I not the same as they are, just at a longer time horizon? I'm also a transient being in the city. They might only be here for three months, but I've only been here for three years as well. As a matter fact, there are bunch of people have done this for generations where their parents and their grandparents and their grandparents all met in New York, and they all decided to live somewhere in the broader region whether it be Westchester, Wilmington, Big Indian, Boston, etc. 
New York City is equally adventurous to each, so who am I to judge how others enjoy this adventurous city. I feel violated by intern season (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/newyorkcity/comments/1lykkqf/i_feel_violated_by_intern_season/)

üéØ Goals:
- I want to transfer from Robinhood, but WB only allows 50k transfers at a time. Each transfer which takes 5 days needs to be completed before I can transfer more. 
Is there no way to transfer 50k per day? 50k at a time?

üò§ Frustrations:
- Oh I hate it when this happens. I remember they were doing all of 10th avenue or something for 20 blocks and it was horrible!

At least the outcome was worth it though

üßç Behaviours:
- Dating apps have been normalized but I still would prefer irl encounters compared to apps. Apps also make you see dates as trivial, since there‚Äôs always another girl one tap away.
I usually take the time to leave quality comments, and around 1/3 of them materialize into matches. Some will just like without responding, but I feel like more often than not they do respond.
It might also be the type of people I‚Äôm attracted to though. I‚Äôve noticed those in their early 20s aren‚Äôt really good at conversations, or get more matches so they don‚Äôt care as much.

Is there a certain demographic you tend to match with? (Race, age, career)

- There are some key technologies which can give you significant advantage in the early game, either in military or in science. The ones for military are composite Bowmans, chariots, crossbow etc, but the great library doesn‚Äôt really help you obtain these since they‚Äôre on the opposite side of the tech tree. As in, if you want to beeline for those it‚Äôs faster to research those tech instead of researching and beelining for great library.

I think the great library can be beneficial in getting to theology faster, which will get you to¬†borobudur. That‚Äôs game changing if you are pushing for religion (which honestly you should unless there are reasons not to).¬†

The great scientist points are great to have early on, although you often use them for bulk popping once you have research labs up and running.

I usually play at deity where the AI starts miles ahead in technology so don‚Äôt even bother, but if you‚Äôre playing king or emperor it should be a decent strat.

- It‚Äôs a combination of multiple factors, your military strength, the amount of GPT/luxury you can offer, their military might, the other civ‚Äôs might, etc.
What seems to impact it the most is how bloodthirsty the AI is. Shaka will go to war with almost anyone, it‚Äôs impossible to get Ghandi to attack, unless he‚Äôs got nukes. I feel that it‚Äôs balanced considering that the violent civs tend to attack you, and those are the ones you can bribe relatively easily.
Even if the civs aren‚Äôt neighbors, if you can get them to declare war on one another they will most likely not attack you, which is already a win. You have the largest disadvantage at the beginning of the game, so it‚Äôs easier to catch up as you invest the resources to non-military infrastructure, while your competitors burn hammers on swords and arrows.
