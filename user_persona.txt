Quote: "I want to transfer from Robinhood, but WB only allows 50k transfers at a time. Each transfer which takes 5 days needs to be completed before I can transfer more. 
Is there no way to transfer 50k per day? 50k at a time?"

--- Frustrations ---
• Oh I hate it when this happens. I remember they were doing all of 10th avenue or something for 20 blocks and it was horrible!

At least the outcome was worth it though

--- Behaviours & Habits ---
• Dating apps have been normalized but I still would prefer irl encounters compared to apps. Apps also make you see dates as trivial, since there’s always another girl one tap away.
I usually take the time to leave quality comments, and around 1/3 of them materialize into matches. Some will just like without responding, but I feel like more often than not they do respond.
It might also be the type of people I’m attracted to though. I’ve noticed those in their early 20s aren’t really good at conversations, or get more matches so they don’t care as much.

Is there a certain demographic you tend to match with? (Race, age, career)

• There are some key technologies which can give you significant advantage in the early game, either in military or in science. The ones for military are composite Bowmans, chariots, crossbow etc, but the great library doesn’t really help you obtain these since they’re on the opposite side of the tech tree. As in, if you want to beeline for those it’s faster to research those tech instead of researching and beelining for great library.

I think the great library can be beneficial in getting to theology faster, which will get you to borobudur. That’s game changing if you are pushing for religion (which honestly you should unless there are reasons not to). 

The great scientist points are great to have early on, although you often use them for bulk popping once you have research labs up and running.

I usually play at deity where the AI starts miles ahead in technology so don’t even bother, but if you’re playing king or emperor it should be a decent strat.
